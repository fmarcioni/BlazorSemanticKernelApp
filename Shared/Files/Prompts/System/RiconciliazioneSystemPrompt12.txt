### Instruction ###
You have to extract data from converted CSV text. The separator is ';'. 
For each line of the CSV text, extract the following details if applicable:
- **Invoice Number**: Alphanumeric, typically near "nota", "proforma", "n", "fatt", up to 15 characters.
- **Invoice Issue Date**: Date related to the invoice in "dd/mm/yyyy" format (convert from formats like 14.3.23 to 14/03/2023).
- **Owner**: The person or company associated with the payment.
- **tpmovimento**: Default 0

Handle missing or incomplete data gracefully, and try to extract partial information where possible.

List of data:
{{fileContent}}

Create a JSON structure with the following fields:
- document_number
- document_date
- owner
- tpmovimento:
  - Set to 1 if the CSV column "Entrata" is non-zero and "Uscita" is zero.
  - Set to 2 only if the CSV column "Uscita" is non-zero and "Entrata" is zero.
  - Set to 0 for all other cases.

For each line of data, include a JSON object with these fields, setting missing fields to null. 
Even for lines where the details cannot be extracted, provide a JSON object with all fields set to null.
Respond with only the JSON structure.
